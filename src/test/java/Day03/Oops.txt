Interface:
It is used to achieve abstraction.
By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
It has abstract methods
There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body


Polymorphism:
Polymorphism means "many forms"
Types - Method overloading & Overriding
 
Method overloading:Two or more methods can have the same name inside the same class if they accept different arguments
Method Overriding: method overriding occurs when a subclass (child class) has the same method as the parent class

Inheritance:
Reusability of code
extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class
* Single - class inherits another class
* Multilevel - chain of inheritance
* Hierarchical - Two or more classes inherits a single class

Encapsulation:
Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit
